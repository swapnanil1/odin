    <h1 class="heading">SELECTORS</h1>
    <h2 class="subheading">Universal Selectors</h2>
    <p class="universal">
      a universal selector applies to all the elements in the html. it is
      defined as * {} and contains in it properties that define the entire doc.
      like for example background-color = yellow , color = black
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Type Selectors</h2>
    <div>
      In CSS, inbuilt HTML elements like span, div, and paragraph can be
      directly modified using their tag names. This means that you can apply
      styles directly to these elements without needing to create a custom class
      or id. For example, you can use the following rules to style all span
      elements with white text and all div elements with black text span {color:
      white;} , div {color: black;}. However, for user-made elements like
      "universal",or "subheading" they must be specified as a class or id within
      an inbuilt HTML element to take effect. This allows for more precise
      control over the styling of your HTML document and the ability to reuse
      styles across multiple elements. For example: div
      class="universal-selector">a universal selector applies to all the
      elements in the html div> Then, add the appropriate style rules for the
      "universal-selector" class in your CSS file: .universal-selector{
      background-color: yellow; color: black; }
    </div>
    <h2 class="subheading">Class selectors</h2>
    <p class="class">
      As mentioned above any custom element must be added as a class selector.
      Note the syntax for Class selectors start with a period followed by the
      case-sensitive value of the class attribute. You can apply multiple
      classes to an element using a space-separated list. Avoid using spaces in
      class names, use hyphens instead for multi-worded names.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">ID selectors</h2>
    <p id="theid">
      ID selectors target elements by their unique ID attribute. Unlike class
      selectors, only one element can have a specific ID on a webpage. This
      makes them useful for selecting a single, distinct element. Just like
      class names, avoid using spaces in IDs and use hyphens instead. Use
      hashtag + case-sensitive value for ID selectors. Be cautious not to
      overuse IDs, classes can be used instead in many cases. While there are
      valid uses for IDs like specificity and section links, use them sparingly.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Grouping selector</h2>
    <p class="group selector">
      You can group two selectors that share common style declarations into a
      comma-separated list: .read, .unread {background-color:black;}
    </p>
    <p class="group">This helps in cut down on the repetition</p>
    <h2 class="chain selector">Chaining selectors</h2>
    <p class="selector">
      Chaining selectors allows you to target specific elements based on
      multiple class or ID combinations. It's useful when you want to apply
      unique styles to elements with multiple classes or IDs. For example,
      .subsection.header targets elements with both the 'subsection' and
      'header' classes. Be cautious not to chain more than one type selector as
      it won't work since an element can't be two different types at once.
    </p>
    <div class="decendent">
    <h2 class="combinator">DC or Decendent Combinator</h2>
    <p class="combinator">
      The Descendant Combinator in CSS, represented by a single space between
      selectors, establishes a relationship where an element is selected only if
      it has an ancestor matching the previous selector. For example, in the
      given CSS rule `.ancestor .contents`, it selects elements with the class
      `contents` only if they have an ancestor with the class `ancestor`.
      Nesting depth doesn't matter; the child is selected as long as it is
      inside the specified ancestor. In the provided HTML example, elements B
      and C, both having the class `contents` and nested inside the `.ancestor`
      element, would be selected. However, element D, having the class
      `contents` but not having an ancestor with the class `ancestor`, would not
      be selected. It's possible to chain multiple combinators in a rule, like
      `.one .two .three .four`, which selects an element with the class `four`
      if it has ancestors with classes `three`, `two`, and `one`. However, it's
      generally recommended to avoid excessive nesting in selectors as it can
      become confusing, lengthy, and may lead to specificity issues.
